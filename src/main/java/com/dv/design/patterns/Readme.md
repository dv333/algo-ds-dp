# Design Patterns

## Creational Design Patterns

In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deals with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. It is primarily based on two main ideas. One is encapsulate the knowledge about which concrete  classes the system uses. Another is hiding how the instances of these classes are created and combined.

> * This patterns are all about different ways to instantiate or create objects

	1. Factory design pattern
	2. Abstract factory design patterns
	3. Builder design patterns
	4. Singleton design patterns
	5. Prototype design patterns

## Structural Design patterns

Structural design patterns show how to glue different pieces of a system together in a flexible and extensible fashion.They help you guarantee that when one of the parts changes, the entire structure does not need to change.

> * This patterns are all about different ways to compose or arrange objects to realize new functionality, i.e. What is the blue print of the classes in the system.

	1. Adaptor design pattern
	2. Bridge design pattern
	3. Composite design pattern
	4. Decorator design pattern
	5. Facade design pattern
	6. Flyweight design pattern
	7. Proxy design patterns

## Behavior Design Patterns

Behavior design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

> * This patterns are all about different ways to communicate between objects, i.e. the ways objects are interconnected.

	1. Chain of responsibility design pattern
	2. Command design pattern
	3. Iterator design pattern
	4. Mediator design pattern
	5. Memento design pattern
	6. Observer design pattern
	7. State design pattern
	8. Strategy design pattern
	9. Template design pattern
	10. Visitor design pattern
